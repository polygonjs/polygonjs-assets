# Assets for Polygonjs

This repository contains assets used in the demos of Polygonjs, the node-based 3D Webgl engine. [Learn more](https://polygonjs.com/).

Many models and textures come directly from the [threejs repository](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), but are added here for convenience.
